## Description:
The goal of this memory game is to make it to the end without clicking the same card twice. To begin the game, random dog photos are fetched from a web API and displayed on 12 cards. On each turn the user picks a card and the cards are shuffled. If the player chooses a card that's already been clicked they lose the game. The player's score is the number of cards clicked without clicking a duplicate. Current score and top score are displayed at the top of the screen.
